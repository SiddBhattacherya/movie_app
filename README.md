# MOVIE APP
This application is developed for Shopify's front-end challenge!

## USAGE
The usage is pretty simple, use the search bar to search for movies. Then, click on the **Nominate** button to nominate a particular 
movie. You can nominate up to **5** movies. A movie can be removed from the nomination by clicking the **Remove** button. Finally, your 
nomination list will be saved even if you navigate away from the page.

## DEVELOPMENT
I started the app with a rough outline of the UI, while focusing on the technical requirements. I used React to create the app, using Bootstrap for styling,
and finally implemented local storage in order to save the "nominated movies" list.
